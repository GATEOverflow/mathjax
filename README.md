# Q2A Formatter
Question2answer Formatter

This plugin provides an option to add MathJax script, Prettify script and a Preview for CKEditor and enables them by default on all pages.

For editor support please use this [modified ckeditor](https://github.com/tangruize/q2a-formatter/releases).

Download the ckeditor and place inside qa-plugin/wysiwyg-editor folder.

It seems that SnowFlat theme renders math font very small for mobile. [SnowLight](https://github.com/gurjyot/SnowLight) theme doesn't have this problem.

I also recommend you to install [q2apro-warn-on-leave](https://github.com/q2apro/q2apro-warn-on-leave) plugin, which warns the user that text area has been changed when he is leaving.

This is a beta code, use it at your own risk on a production environment.
